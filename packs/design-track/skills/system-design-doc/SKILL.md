# system-design-doc

## What this is

A system design doc specifies **one system** — a cache's admission and eviction rules, a retry policy, a scheduler, an interaction model — as a **model**, and argues the **dynamics** that model produces: the behaviour the rules create, and why that behaviour delivers what the locked design says the project is for. It is the *earliest* doc in the pipeline — a design-track doc authored on a design branch and **locked at G1**, upstream of the feature-requirement doc (the buildable contract) and the architecture doc (the how).

The anchor idea, and the test of every line:

> **Specify the model; argue the dynamics. The design *intent* is what G1 locks — the numbers are provisional.**

A doc that only *describes mechanics* and never reasons about what *emerges* from them is a rulebook, not a design. The value is the argument that *these rules → this behaviour → the goal the locked design states*. So the test of every line is: *is this a decision you could lock at G1, and would it survive the numbers being tuned later?* If the line is really a number, defer it to the tuning pass and flag it provisional. If it is an implementation choice, it belongs in the architecture doc. If it is a buildable acceptance check, it belongs in requirements. Everything that stays is model, dynamics, or a resolved fork.

## The two forms

`## What this is` describes the **systems form**. The skill has a second, the **deliverable form**, for work whose design is its content and audience — a document, a deck, a dataset — rather than a mechanism's dynamics.

**The test:** is the work's design content and audience, or a mechanism's dynamics? The PM applies it and names the form with the topic's scope at ORIENT; the human rules on it at G1. One form per doc: a work with both gets two docs.

**What differs by form in the workflow:** only SETTLE's content, DRAFT's template and BAR's bar, each where its step says, and the frontmatter `type`, where `## Filing and bookkeeping` says. Everything else — the prerequisites, GATHER, FORKS and `## The ADR convention`, FILE and the rest of `## Filing and bookkeeping` — holds for both forms as written; for a deliverable doc, a "system" in that text reads as the deliverable, and "the model" or "the settled model" as its settled content.

**The test of every line**, for a deliverable, is item 4 of `## The deliverable quality bar`, content altitude, in place of the anchor above.

**Changes after G1:** a deliverable doc is unlocked and the changed section rewritten in place; the form has no amendments section.

## Bindings

- `process-docs` (required) — where design docs live and what they are called, and therefore where this topic's directory and its `decisions/` subdirectory sit. Absent → stop and say so before any brief is filed.
- `vc` (required) — the branch procedure (the design branch this work runs on, never the main branch) and the check-in procedure for the files drafted here.
- `board` (optional) — where cross-session state lives beyond `memory/STATUS.md`, and therefore where this topic's row is updated. Absent → `memory/STATUS.md` is the state; orient from what the project binds.
- Agents — `doc-writer` missing → stop after SETTLE and say so.

## When it applies — and prerequisites

Trigger: the design track for a system is active. Before drafting, confirm:

- **You are on a design branch** (G0 done — branch exists, scope agreed), created per the `vc` binding's branch procedure. Not on the main branch.
- **This is docs, not code.** Design precedes implementation. Do **not** scaffold, move, or edit code in this phase, even to "set things up" — treat that as a hard line.
- **You will not cross G1 on your own judgment.** "Locked" is the human's call, and it is ruled elsewhere: core's `g1-lock` owns that stop and nothing here stops at G1. You draft, explore forks, and hold the bar.
- **A locked decision is immutable.** If drafting a coupled system reveals a locked sibling decision is wrong, **stop**: reopen that design on a design branch, amend it, re-lock at G1. Never silently patch a locked decision from a neighbouring doc.

## What the system derives from

Unlike a requirements doc, which derives from *locked* design, a system design doc derives from the **layer above it**:

1. **The stated goals of the locked design.** Every system exists to deliver part of a goal the design states, and conflicts resolve in favour of that goal. Open by naming which goal(s) this system carries, and cite the doc that states them.
2. **The parent hub and its source.** The topic's overview doc and the relevant section of the source it derives from. Where the source numbers its sections, trace to that number.
3. **Already-locked sibling systems.** A new system must stay consistent with the locked decisions of the systems it couples to. Read them first; cite them.

Read those fully before drafting. A mechanism that traces to no stated goal is flavour or scope creep — surface it, do not paper over it.

## Workflow

1. **ORIENT** — confirm the design topic, the branch and the scope: the branch per the `vc` binding's branch procedure, the cross-session state per the `board` binding. Nothing is drafted before the topic and its scope are agreed. The form — systems or deliverable — is named with the topic and its scope, by `## The two forms`.
2. **GATHER** — read the layer above: the goals the locked design states, the parent hub and its source section, and the locked sibling systems this one couples to. Cite each; an uncited parent is an assumption.
3. **SETTLE** — the first hard stop: the PM and the human work the system out in conversation until the model is settled — the state it tracks and the rules that move it, the decisions it puts to its operator, the dynamics reasoned forward and then war-gamed for degeneracy, and the boundaries it owns, couples to, hands off and deliberately does not decide. That settled content is the decision record the next step's brief carries: `doc-writer` records decisions and never makes one, so nothing agreed here may be left for it to invent. Where the model has a genuine unknown rather than a settled answer, it leaves this step as an open item and surfaces at FORKS for the human's ruling. For a deliverable, what is settled is the content G1 locks — its audience and purpose, its form and constraints, each part's intent and key content, its sources and facts, and its exclusions — with any text the human dictates recorded verbatim and marked dictated, and each number recorded either as a limit set from outside, with its source, or as a target the project set itself, provisional.
4. **DRAFT** — file `.scratch/doc-writer-<topic>-<system>-brief.md` from `.claude/references/core/decision-brief.md`: the settled model and its open items, plus the parents and their citations, as the decision record, `assets/design-doc-template.md` as the skeleton, and the target directory and file name per the `process-docs` binding. Dispatch `doc-writer` through the Agent tool without a `name`. The brief says to order the middle sections to fit the system and to keep the top `> **What's decided.**` callout and the two bookends. For a deliverable, the skeleton is `assets/deliverable-doc-template.md` instead, and the brief says to keep its headings in the template's order — the deliverable's own structure lives in `## The parts`.
5. **BAR** — judge the returned draft against `## The quality bar` below. For the hard parts — arguing the dynamics, killing degenerate strategies, keeping numbers out of the model — `references/quality-bar.md` carries the worked examples and the altitude-stack table. A miss is a second brief to `doc-writer`, never a PM edit; where the miss is a gap in the settled model rather than in the writing, the fix is upstream — settle it with the human first, then re-brief. A deliverable draft is judged against `## The deliverable quality bar` instead; `references/quality-bar.md` is the systems form's.
6. **FORKS** — the second hard stop: where a decision is genuinely open, lay the tradeoff out in prose and let the human rule. Do not force a picker, do not silently pick. On a contested fork, independent derivations judged against one another are strong signal where they converge — the technique is kept, the panel is not fixed. Each ruling becomes an ADR; what stays unresolved is parked in `## Status / openness`, and the downstream docs inherit it.
7. **FILE** — the ADRs per `## The ADR convention`, the doc and its bookkeeping per `## Filing and bookkeeping`.

## The ADR convention

A genuine fork — a contested decision with real tradeoffs — is recorded as an ADR, and the record is `doc-writer`'s to write from a brief carrying the human's ruling.

- **Where:** under the design topic's own directory — wherever the `process-docs` binding puts design docs — in a `decisions/` subdirectory, created lazily on that topic's first ADR.
- **Named:** `adr-NNNN-<slug>.md`, with a four-digit sequence. **Check the highest existing number on disk before claiming one** — concurrent sessions share the sequence; never reuse a number.
- **Shaped by** `assets/adr-template.md`.
- **Covering:** every contested decision points at its `adr-NNNN`, and the keystone fork gets its own.
- **Keeping the rejected branch, with the reason it lost.** That is what lets a later contradiction reopen the design from the reasoning instead of guessing which assumption broke.

## The quality bar

Every system design doc must clear these. (Expanded, with good/bad examples: `references/quality-bar.md`.)

1. **Traced to a stated goal — open by naming what it serves.** Every system delivers part of a goal the locked design states; name which, and cite the doc. A system that traces to no stated goal is flavour or scope creep.
2. **The decision space is the heart.** A system is interesting because of the *decisions* it puts to its operator. Enumerate them — the choice, the information available when choosing, the opportunity cost, why no option dominates. No interesting decision → it is not a system.
3. **Model altitude — not numbers, not implementation.** Specify the *model* (the state it tracks, the rules, how one step resolves). Defer the **numbers** to the tuning pass and flag them provisional. Defer **implementation** (classes, components) to the architecture doc. Defer the **buildable acceptance check** to requirements. A good design survives all three being filled in later.
4. **Argue the dynamics — and war-game them.** Reason forward from the rules to the behaviour that emerges. Then attack your own rules: where is the dominant strategy, the degenerate loop, the dead zone — and the rule that kills each? This is first-class here, not an appendix.
5. **Draw the boundaries — own / couple / hand off / explicitly do not decide.** State what this system owns, what it consumes from siblings, what it pushes elsewhere, and what it deliberately does *not* decide. Naming the non-decisions keeps each doc independently lockable and stops one system silently deciding another's.
6. **Cash the model out into what it delivers.** Close the loop: this model → this behaviour → the goal's promised outcome. If you cannot say what it is like when it goes right, the dynamics argument is not finished.
7. **Forks recorded as ADRs.** Every contested decision points to its `adr-NNNN`; the keystone fork gets its own. Keep the rejected branch and *why it lost* — that is what lets a later contradiction reopen the design intelligently instead of guessing which assumption broke.
8. **Right-sized, and honest about openness.** A few screens, not a specification suite. Mark the locked skeleton (the `> **What's decided.**` callout), flag every number provisional, and end with the open items and forward dependencies you did *not* resolve.

**Smell tests:** describes rules but never what emerges → rulebook; add the dynamics. A number presented as decided → move it to the tuning pass. Names a class → architecture, not design. No goal cited → unparented. No degeneracy analysis → unstress-tested. No non-decisions or hand-offs → unscoped.

## The deliverable quality bar

Every deliverable design doc must clear these.

1. **Traced to a stated goal.** Name which goal of the locked design the deliverable serves, and cite the doc.
2. **Audience and purpose explicit.**
3. **Every part has an intent, not only content.**
4. **Content altitude.** G1 locks intent and key content; final wording, layout and styling are the build's, except text the human dictated, which is recorded verbatim and marked dictated. Numbers follow the numbers rule: a limit set from outside is locked, with its source cited; a target the project set itself is provisional.
5. **Every fact is sourced** to a material or to the human's dated word; an unsourced fact is invented.
6. **Exclusions as sharp as inclusions.**
7. **What it delivers is stated.**
8. **Right-sized, ending with the open items.**

**Smell tests:** a part with no intent; a fact with no source; no audience; a pixel-level layout spec, which is the build; no exclusions.

## Filing and bookkeeping

- **Location:** where the `process-docs` binding says design docs live, kebab-case, one system per page; the topic's ADRs in its `decisions/` subdirectory. New files are added to version control per the `vc` binding's check-in procedure.
- **Frontmatter:**
  ```yaml
  ---
  type: system        # system (a designed mechanism) | concept (a cross-cutting tension or legibility model) | overview (a topic hub)
  topic: <the design topic this system belongs to>
  tags: [kebab, tags]
  status: draft        # draft while designing; stable only for an as-built design-of-record reverse-documented from shipped code
  updated: YYYY-MM-DD   # absolute date, never "today"
  sources:
    - <the parent doc and the section this system derives from>
    - <the topic's decisions/adr-NNNN-*.md>
    - "Session direction YYYY-MM-DD (...)"
  ---
  ```
- **Deliverable frontmatter:** a deliverable doc's frontmatter is its template's, `assets/deliverable-doc-template.md` — `type: deliverable`, the other keys as above.
- **Prose and linking convention:** keep each paragraph and list item on one logical line — no hard-wrapped prose. For link and date form, match what the project's existing process docs already do; where there are none, link by relative path and write dates absolute (`YYYY-MM-DD`). End with `## Status / openness`, then `## Related`.
- **Mark unbuilt content:** a line that states forward design intent rather than as-built fact carries `(design intent, not yet built)` inline, so a reader of a design-of-record can tell the two apart line by line.
- **Update the cross-session state:** add or update the topic's row where the `board` binding says — track `design`, stage `design-doc`, the pre-G1 design stage. No board bound → `memory/STATUS.md` is the state.
- **Do not touch the product surface.** A project's product docs are written only after G2 acceptance, by the agent that reconciles them; writing there now is a layer violation. Design docs are process docs, and their only bookkeeping is the row above. Cross-*linking* to a product page is fine; creating or editing one from here is not.
- **Check in only when the human asks**, per the `vc` binding's check-in procedure. Concurrent sessions edit the same cross-session state and share the ADR sequence — re-read both, and re-check the highest ADR number on disk, before appending.
