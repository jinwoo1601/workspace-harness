# feature-requirement-doc

## What this is

A feature-requirement doc turns one slice of **G1-locked design** into a precise, scoped, testable contract for a single buildable feature — **without deciding how to build it**. It sits in one specific gap in the workflow: *after* the design is locked, *before* the architecture doc, which is the *how* and the working record the build keeps as it goes.

The anchor idea, and the test of every line:

> **The requirements doc is the G2 acceptance checklist, written in advance.**

G2 is *feature accepted* — the human's sign-off. If at G2 the human cannot walk the doc ticking each line against the built thing, including the checks only a human can run, the doc failed its one job. Everything below follows from that.

## Bindings

- `process-docs` (required) — where feature docs live and what they are called, and therefore where this feature's directory and its requirements doc sit. Absent → stop and say so before any brief is filed.
- `vc` (required) — the branch procedure (the feature branch this work runs on, never the main branch) and the check-in procedure for the file drafted here.
- `board` (optional) — where cross-session state lives beyond `memory/STATUS.md`, and therefore where this feature's row is updated. Absent → `memory/STATUS.md` is the state; orient from what the project binds.
- Agents — `doc-writer` missing → stop after SETTLE and say so. `architect-reconcile` missing → on a return the record pass is reported as not done and the two sites stand, which misroutes nothing (`.claude/references/core/feature-lite.md` `## The mark`).

## When it applies — and prerequisites

Trigger: the implementation track for a feature begins. A lite feature gets this skill only on its return to the full track (`.claude/references/core/feature-lite.md` `## The return to full`). Before drafting, confirm:

- **The design is locked (G1).** Requirements derive from locked design; they never invent it. If the parent design is not locked, **stop** — that is a design-track problem, not a requirements one.
- **You are on a feature branch**, created per the `vc` binding's branch procedure. Not on the main branch.
- **This is docs, not code.** Requirements — and the architecture doc after them — are written before any implementation. Do **not** scaffold, move, or edit code in this phase, even to "set things up"; treat that as a hard line.
- **The human owns the scope and priority calls.** The PM gathers, settles, surfaces tradeoffs and holds the bar; it never invents a requirement the locked design does not support, and it does not cross G2 — that ruling is core's `g2-accept`, and nothing here stops at G2.
- **A locked decision is immutable.** If building later reveals a requirement contradicts locked design, **stop**: reopen that design on a design branch, amend it, re-lock at G1. Never silently patch a locked decision from a requirements doc.

## Where the feature comes from

A feature comes off the backlog the design track produces when a locked design is broken into features — one feature name and one line of scope each — and where a project keeps no such list, off the locked design docs themselves. Step one is to pin down, **with the human**:

1. **Which feature** — its name (kebab-case) and its one-line scope.
2. **Its parent design** — the specific design doc(s) and decision record(s) it derives from. These become the doc's `sources:` and the spine of every requirement.
3. **Its user story** — the story or stories the feature serves, as `g0-open` recorded them in the doc's §1: read them back and confirm them verbatim with the human. Only where §1 is empty — a feature opened before G0 recorded stories — is the story pinned down here, each *As a \<user\>, I want \<capability\>, so that \<value\>.*, captured verbatim. On a return the stories are those of the architecture doc's `## User story` (`.claude/references/core/feature-lite.md` `## The return to full`).

Read those parents **fully** before drafting. A requirement with no parent in locked design is either scope creep or a sign the design is not actually locked — surface it, do not paper over it.

## Workflow

1. **ORIENT** — confirm the feature, the branch and that the design is locked: the branch per the `vc` binding's branch procedure, the cross-session state per the `board` binding. Nothing is drafted before the feature and its one-line scope are agreed.
2. **GATHER** — read the feature's requirements doc as `g0-open` began it — its §1 and §2 — and the locked design doc(s) and decision record(s) the feature derives from, in full, plus any already-merged feature this one depends on. Cite each; an uncited parent is an assumption. On a return §1 and §2 come from the architecture doc's two G0 sections, and §9 opens as `.claude/references/core/feature-lite.md` `## The return to full` says.
3. **SETTLE** — the first hard stop: the PM and the human work the feature out in conversation until its content is settled — opening with the user story as G0 recorded it — confirmed, not re-settled; §1 is settled here only where it is empty; on a return the stop opens with the unfixed choice, before the story, as `.claude/references/core/feature-lite.md` `## The return to full` says — then the scope and the non-goals, the value it delivers, the observable behaviour that shows it working, each functional requirement with its priority and the check that verifies it, the non-functional rows this project's platform makes load-bearing, the dependencies and the assumptions, and the G2 acceptance criteria. That is §§1–9 of `assets/requirements-template.md` in full, and it is the decision record the next step's brief carries: `doc-writer` records decisions and never makes one, so nothing left unsettled here is available for it to invent. A genuine unknown rather than a settled answer leaves this step open and surfaces at FORKS for the human's ruling; §10 is the one section this step does not settle.
4. **DRAFT** — file `.scratch/doc-writer-<feature>-requirements-brief.md` from `.claude/references/core/decision-brief.md`: the settled content and its open items as the decision record, the parents and their citations, `assets/requirements-template.md` as the skeleton, and the target directory and file name per the `process-docs` binding. Dispatch `doc-writer` through the Agent tool without a `name`.
5. **BAR** — judge the returned draft against `## The quality bar` below. For the hard parts — cashing a "feel" target out into an observable proxy, keeping *how* out of *what* — `references/quality-bar.md` carries the worked examples and the *Operationalizing "feel"* table. A miss is a second brief to `doc-writer`, never a PM edit; where the miss is a gap in the settled content rather than in the writing, the fix is upstream — settle it with the human first, then re-brief.
6. **FORKS** — the second hard stop: where scope, priority, a deferred non-goal or a requirement's value is genuinely open, lay the tradeoff out in prose and let the human rule. Do not force a picker, do not silently pick. What stays unresolved is parked in `## 10. Open questions`, and the architecture doc inherits it.
7. **FILE** — the doc and its bookkeeping per `## Filing and bookkeeping`. On a return, once the doc is filed, file `.scratch/architect-reconcile-<feature>-return-brief.md` — the architecture doc and the new requirements doc by path, and the two corrections `.claude/references/core/feature-lite.md` `## The return to full` names — and dispatch `architect-reconcile` in its record mode through the Agent tool without a `name`.

## The quality bar

Every requirement must clear these. (Expanded, with good/bad examples: `references/quality-bar.md`.)

1. **Testable — done is observable.** Each requirement has an acceptance check someone could run against the built thing. A subjective "feel" target is allowed *only* once cashed out into an observable proxy, with the feel target kept alongside as the rationale.
2. **What and why, never how.** No class, data layout, component or algorithm — a good requirement survives a total re-implementation. Genuine *constraints* (a latency ceiling, reuse of an existing pipeline) are allowed: they bound the solution, they do not choose it.
3. **Traced upward.** Each requirement cites the locked design doc or decision record it derives from, and names the stated goal of that design it serves, and each traces to a user story in §1. A requirement that traces to no stated goal, or has no story behind it, is scope creep.
4. **Scoped — non-goals as sharp as goals.** State what the feature does *not* do, what is deferred to a later feature, and which adjacent systems it touches but does not own.
5. **Prioritized — Must / Should / Could.** The Musts define the minimal G2-acceptable version; that is what lets a feature ship instead of sprawling.
6. **Non-functional requirements are first-class — some are feature-killers.** Take the rows this project's platform makes load-bearing — the performance budget, the behaviour at the input boundary when input is lossy or unrecognized, what the feature does when a dependency is degraded, and accessibility — and cut the rows that do not apply rather than leaving them blank.
7. **Dependencies and assumptions stated.** What must already exist or be merged first — features are dependency-ordered, so declare the order — and what is assumed about the people using it and the rest of the system.
8. **Right-sized and honest about unknowns.** A page or three, not a specification suite. End with the open questions you did *not* resolve; the architecture doc would rather inherit a known unknown than hit it mid-build.

**Smell tests:** cannot test it → rewrite it as something observable. Names a class or component → it is architecture; move it to the architecture doc. A "feel" word with no proxy → unfinished. No non-goals → unscoped. No upward citation → unparented, or the design is not actually locked.

## Filing and bookkeeping

- **Location:** where the `process-docs` binding says feature docs live, kebab-case, one directory per feature; a project's first feature creates that directory. New files are added to version control per the `vc` binding's check-in procedure.
- **Frontmatter:**
  ```yaml
  ---
  type: requirements
  feature: <kebab-name>
  topic: <the design topic this feature belongs to>
  status: draft         # draft until G2; accepted at G2 by g2-accept RECORD
  updated: YYYY-MM-DD   # absolute date, never "today"
  sources:
    - <the locked design doc(s) this feature derives from>
    - <the decision record(s) behind them>
  ---
  ```
- **Prose and linking convention:** keep each paragraph and list item on one logical line — no hard-wrapped prose. For link and date form, match what the project's existing process docs already do; where there are none, link by relative path and write dates absolute (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **Update the cross-session state:** add or update the feature's row where the `board` binding says — track `feature`, stage `requirements`, the post-G1 pre-architecture stage. No board bound → `memory/STATUS.md` is the state.
- **Do not touch the product surface.** A project's product docs are written only after G2 acceptance, by the agent that reconciles them; writing there now is a layer violation. Requirements are process docs, and their only bookkeeping is the row above. Cross-*linking* to a product page is fine; creating or editing one from here is not.
- **Check in only when the human asks**, per the `vc` binding's check-in procedure. Concurrent sessions edit the same cross-session state — re-read it before appending.
