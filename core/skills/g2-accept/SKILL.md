# g2-accept

## What this is

**G2 is the human's ruling; everything here prepares evidence for it or executes its consequences.** Preflight audits the preconditions, the human rules, and only then are the ruling recorded, product docs written, the branch merged, and the state closed out.

> Nothing crosses G2 on the assistant's judgment. Preflight prepares, the human rules, and only then do product docs and merge exist.

## Bindings

- `vc` (required) — what STAGE needs staged for the ruling form, the read commands the preflight runs, the *Branch procedure*, whose lab form Prerequisites refuses, and MERGE's merge procedure. Absent → stop and say so before any brief is filed.
- `verification` (required) — the commands whose run evidence the preflight's item 2 looks for, quoted into the preflight brief; `none` is a filled value (item 2 reports `nothing to run`). On the tree path, also the commands CATCH-UP's `compile-check` runs in the branch's tree, where `none` has CATCH-UP record `nothing to run`. Absent → stop and say so before the brief is filed.
- `process-docs` (required) — the docs `gate-preflight` audits and RECORD writes to.
- `product-docs` (optional) — the location and the reconciling agent. `none bound` → PRODUCT DOCS is reported as not applicable. A location with a named reconciling agent → that agent is dispatched from a decision-style brief only if it exists in the composed set, else the step is reported, never improvised.
- `board` (optional) — default `none — memory/STATUS.md`. A bound board → CLOSE OUT advances or retires its row.
- `trees` (optional) — the Hub path ROOT compares with this session's root and the `scripts/hub.py lock` commands take as `--root`; the List read that confirms the branch's tree; the Catch-up procedure; and the Clean read and the Hub slot's idiom by which HUB READ and MERGE run in the hub. Absent → today's path. Filled → the steps run as `references/tree-path.md` orders them.
- `session-launch` (optional) — the Hub session name, to which the tree path's REMOVE sends `FINISHED`. Absent, or the Hub session name missing or `none` → REMOVE as today and no report sent.
- Agents — `gate-preflight` missing → stop before any dispatch and say so. `doc-writer` missing → RECORD is reported as not done; the ruling stands in the conversation and the session note. `compile-check` missing → where CATCH-UP brings the main branch in, stop before the merge and say so. `architect-reconcile` missing → the architecture doc's `status:` move, and a lite feature's whole RECORD, are reported as not done, the ruling standing as said of `doc-writer`.

## Prerequisites

Confirm before proceeding:
- The review cycle is done and its fixes are committed.
- The checkout is on the feature branch per the `vc` binding's base-revision reads.
- Every command the `verification` binding names is green at the head presented (`compile-check`'s last PASS).
- The branch is not in the lab form: the lab form the `vc` binding's *Branch procedure* names, or `lab-<topic>` where it names none (a `<…>` placeholder matches any text). A lab branch merges nothing → stop and say so before any brief is filed.

## Workflow

Where `trees` is filled, as the contract reads it, these steps run as `references/tree-path.md` orders them; otherwise they run as written.

1. **PREFLIGHT** — file `.scratch/g2-accept-<feature>-preflight-brief.md` from the common fields of `.claude/references/core/brief-fields.md` (the `vc`, `board`, `verification`, and `trees` bindings quoted; the feature's process docs by absolute path per `process-docs`), then dispatch `gate-preflight` through the Agent tool without a `name`. The skill applies the test of `.claude/references/core/feature-lite.md` `## The mark` here; for a lite feature the brief says `lite`, gives the backlog's path and the feature's name, quotes the row and cites its criteria as A1…An (`.claude/references/core/feature-lite.md` `## The acceptance source`).
2. **PRESENT** — read the audit: per-item PASS / FAIL / UNVERIFIABLE with evidence. A FAIL → remediate and re-run the preflight, never presented as acceptable, save item 2's human-only FAIL, carried by the packet (`.claude/references/core/gate-packet.md` `## The G2 packet`); the audit is relayed in HARD STOP's packet, not alone.
3. **STAGE** — per the `vc` binding: nothing to stage when the ruling form is in-conversation; the vc pack's staging skill when the binding names one.
4. **HARD STOP — the G2 ruling.** Put the G2 packet (`.claude/references/core/gate-packet.md` `## The G2 packet`) by `.claude/references/core/ruling-form.md`, asking for the human's explicit acceptance with the audit in view; an acceptance given earlier is held as `## The early word` says, and a stood word is that ruling; "Accept, but fix X" is taken as `## The G2 packet` says. Preflight PASS is not acceptance; silence, enthusiasm, or a "looks good" about anything but the gate is not a ruling. The ruling's form — where and how it is given: in conversation, a pull-request approval, … — is the one the `vc` binding names; `ruling-form.md` governs what the PM's message puts to the human. Only that ruling unlocks steps 5–8.
5. **RECORD** — file `.scratch/doc-writer-<feature>-g2-brief.md` from `.claude/references/core/decision-brief.md`: the ruling — who, when, in what form — as the decision record, the requirements doc as the target per `process-docs`, naming beside the G2 record its frontmatter `status:` from `draft` to `accepted` and its `updated:` to the ruling's date. Dispatch `doc-writer`. For every feature, RECORD also moves the architecture doc's frontmatter `status:` from `draft` to `accepted` and its `updated:` to the ruling's date: file `.scratch/architect-reconcile-<feature>-g2-brief.md` naming those two lines and dispatch `architect-reconcile` in its record mode — for a lite feature, the brief and dispatch below, which name them beside the G2 record. For a lite feature the target is the architecture doc, and the brief and dispatch that follow take the place of `doc-writer`'s: file `.scratch/architect-reconcile-<feature>-g2-brief.md` — `lite` and the rest `.claude/references/core/feature-lite.md` `## The acceptance source` asks of a lite feature's brief, the ruling, the head accepted, and the record's form and place as `.claude/references/core/feature-lite.md` `## The three placements` fixes them — and dispatch `architect-reconcile` in its record mode to write the G2 record.
6. **PRODUCT DOCS** — per the `product-docs` binding as `## Bindings` above says. Written only after the ruling, every claim verified against live source.
7. **MERGE** — per the `vc` binding's merge procedure. **The G2 ruling is itself the word to merge**; there is no second stop. Relay first what was authored *after* the ruling — RECORD's edit and any product-doc changes, the fix's diff after "Accept, but fix X" or the human-only re-run, and each option taken after the ruling with its option text — as a diff the human can read, then merge. Show, do not ask again.
8. **CLOSE OUT** — the PM's `memory/STATUS.md` line (within the `board` binding's *STATUS line cap* — absent or `none` → no cap stated); the board row per the `board` binding when one is bound. The same act writes the session's dated note as `.claude/references/core/gate-close.md` `## The dated note` says.
9. **HANDOFF** — invoke `handoff` for the next session's task.
